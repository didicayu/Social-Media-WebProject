# First Deliverable - Social Media Project
Our project aims to explore the relationship between social media engagement and consumer behavior. By analyzing interactions between users, brands, and products/services, we intend to understand how social media influences purchasing decisions.

The data model depicts three main entities: Social Media Users (with their interactions), Brands/Companies, and Products/Services, with various relationships among them. Users engage with multiple brands and products/services, while brands target multiple users and offer various products/services.

We will utilize APIs from social media platforms to collect relevant data. This data will enable us to analyze user interactions, brand mentions, and product/service reviews, providing insights into the impact of social media on consumerÂ behavior.
